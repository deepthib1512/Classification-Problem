# Classification-Problem
Developed a classification model to analyze a small dataset.

Dataset:
  - The dataset is taken from one my online classes. This is a simple dataset, where a company sends email promotions to people
    of various age groups. It has two independent variables, 'Age' and 'Gender' and the target variable 'TookAction' which tells 
    if the person has taken any action. So, this is a binary classification problem.
    
Classification model:
  - Developed the model using sklearn python library
